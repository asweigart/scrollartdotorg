Summary: Make your own scroll art in the browser with this JSFiddle template.

Here is a template preloaded with the [BextJS](https://github.com/asweigart/bextjs) code so that you can create your own scroll art in the browser with the [JSFiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net) JavaScript sandbox:

[BextJS Template: https://jsfiddle.net/asweigart/5skyrhc1/](https://jsfiddle.net/asweigart/5skyrhc1/)

BextJS provides a `print()` function to print strings to the &lt;textarea&gt; element and a `sleep()` function to pause for a certain number of milliseconds. Note thtat you must put the `await` keyword in front of every `sleep()` function call.

On the JSFiddle site, scroll down the HTML area until you find the **`// !!!! INSERT YOUR SCROLL ART PROGRAM CODE BELOW !!!!`** comment and place your JavaScript code there. The above BextJS template currently preloaded with some short "Hello, world!" code. You can replace this with your own scroll art code experiments and not have to worry about getting a programming environment set up on your computer.

All of the scroll art featured on this website have a "JavaScript source code in JSFiddle" link to JSFiddle preloaded with their code, so you can make experiment with changes and view the results in the browser.
